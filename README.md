# Colon Cancer Classification with Explainable AI

This repository presents a deep learning–based approach for classifying
colonoscopy images into three classes: **colon cancer**, **normal colon**,
and **polyp**.

Two transfer learning architectures, **InceptionV3** and **Xception**, are
used and compared. Model predictions are interpreted using **Grad-CAM**
to provide visual explanations highlighting clinically relevant regions
in the images.

The repository focuses on model architecture, training methodology,
evaluation results, and explainable AI visualizations.
